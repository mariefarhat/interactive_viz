2007,Econ,The Great Recession,"The nationwide downturn in U.S. housing prices triggered a global financial crisis, a bear market in stocks that had the S&P 500 down 57% at the lows, and the worst economic downturn since the recession of 1937-38. Global investment flows into the U.S. had kept market rates low, likely encouraging unscrupulous mortgage underwriting and mortgage-backed securities marketing practices. Oil prices spiked to record highs by mid-2008 and then crashed, depressing the U.S. oil industry. Dropping oil and commodity prices led to deflation and strained the U.S. economy."

2020,Econ,The COVID-19 Recession,"The COVID-19 pandemic spread to the U.S. in early 2020, and the resulting travel and work restrictions caused employment to plummet, triggering an unusually short but sharp recession. The unemployment rate climbed from 3.5% in February 2020 to 14.7% in April 2020 but was back below 4% by the end of 2021, capped by $5 trillion in pandemic relief spending. In addition, quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve expanded its balance sheet from $4.1 trillion in February 2020 to nearly $9 trillion by the end of 2021, complementing a federal funds rate that remained near zero until March 2022."
2008,SNAP,"The Food, Conservation, and Energy Act","The 2008 Farm Bill (The Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008) (PL 110–234) was enacted May 22, 2008, through an override of the President's veto. The new law increased the commitment to federal food assistance programs by more than $10 billion over the next 10 years. In efforts to fight stigma, the law changed the name of the federal program to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP as of Oct. 1, 2008, and changed the name of the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008. States maintained flexibility to name the program on their own but were encouraged to change the name to SNAP or another alternate name. In fact, more than 10 states had already changed the names of their programs by this time.\nSignificantly, the 2008 Farm Bill also institutionalized priorities that FNS had focused on for many years including strengthening integrity, simplifying administration, maintaining state flexibility, improving health through nutrition education, and improving access. With regards to nutrition education, Section 4111 clarified the legal basis and requirements for nutrition education in SNAP. With the program's name change, the nutrition education component became known as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Education or SNAP-Ed.\nBenefits were augmented for most households on Oct. 1, 2008, due to the increase in the minimum benefit and standard deduction, and elimination of the cap on the deduction for childcare expenses. The new law also expanded eligibility by indexing the asset limits to inflation, and excluding combat pay as well as most retirement and education accounts as countable resources. The law modernized the program by acknowledging EBT as the standard issuance vehicle and de-obligating coupons one year from enactment. The Farm Bill also provided $20 million in mandatory funding for a project known as the Healthy Incentives Pilot to test point-of-purchase incentives for healthful foods and authorized appropriations for other similar projects."
2009,SNAP,American Recovery & Reinvestment Act,"The American Recovery & Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) (PL 111-5) was passed in response to the Great Recession, which began in December of 2007, to stimulate the economy and facilitate economic recovery. Among the provisions in ARRA was the authority to increase SNAP benefit levels. Since SNAP households spend nearly 97 percent of their benefits within the first month, the increased benefits were viewed as providing an immediate economic stimulus to the economy. SNAP households received the increased benefits between April 1, 2009, and Oct. 31, 2013.\nFor a four-person household, the enhanced benefits amounted to approximately $80 extra per month in 2009. The value of the enhanced benefit was to gradually phase-out as the value of the enhanced benefit was naturally eroded by the inflationary increases in food prices (and corresponding increases in the annual SNAP maximum allotments). However, the enhanced benefits were sunset early on Nov. 1, 2013, to help pay for a provision in the Healthy Hunger Free Kids Act of 2010. The Recovery Act also provided nearly $300 million to states for SNAP administrative expenses in FY 2009 and 2010."
2010,SNAP,"Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act","The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (HHFKA) (PL 111-296) which reauthorized the school nutrition programs, was signed into law on Dec. 13, 2010, and had implications for SNAP nutrition education. It restructured SNAP-Ed as the Nutrition Education and Obesity Prevention Grant Program, changing its financial structure to that of 100 percent federal grant funding to states with no state contribution or match. The Act also reshaped SNAP-Ed by including an emphasis on programming centered on obesity prevention in addition to nutrition education and the promotion of physical activity. Moreover, activities were to be evidence-based and delivered through individual and group-based strategies, comprehensive multi-level interventions, and/or community and public health approaches. Many SNAP-Ed efforts increased their focus on policy, systems, and environmental change (PSE) interventions, with a stronger emphasis on partnerships.\nParticipating state agencies submit an annual SNAP-Ed Plan to FNS. This plan outlines the state’s nutrition education activities and budget for the following year. The number of state agencies with approved SNAP-Ed plans increased from seven in 1992 to 52 state agencies by FY2010. Federal funds approved for SNAP-Ed also grew from $661,000 in 1992 to over $380 million in 2010. This amount represents the federal share of states' total approved funds for SNAP-Ed. In FY 2017, federal funding for the grant program to 50 participating state agencies and 3 U.S. territories totaled $414 million."
2014,SNAP,Agricultural Act,"The Agricultural Act of 2014 (PL 113-79) also known as the 2014 Farm Bill, was signed into law by President Obama on Feb. 7, 2014. Its passage was over 2-years in the making. In the summer of 2013, the House of Representatives split the Farm Bill into two separate bills with farm programs in one bill and the nutrition programs in another. The Senate passed a Farm Bill re-combining these two sections and this bill was the basis for the conference committee's reconciliation in early 2014.\nThe 2014 Farm Bill made many important changes to SNAP. Among the retailer related provisions, it required FNS to update the stocking standards used to authorize SNAP retailers and provided additional resources to fight retailer fraud. It also called for pilot testing the use of mobile devices to redeem SNAP benefits and to pilot test accepting SNAP benefits through online transactions. The 2014 Farm Bill expanded the definition of retailer to include government agencies and not-for-profits that purchase and deliver food to the elderly and/or disabled, thus allowing for testing of home delivery for these vulnerable populations, and allowed agricultural producers who market directly to consumers to accept EBT. The Farm Bill also authorized Food Insecurity and Nutrition Incentive (FINI) Grants to incentivize the purchase of fruits and vegetables among SNAP participants at retailers like grocery stores and farmers markets."

Notes,"Estimates represent the percent of the civilian labor force (age 16 and older) that was unemployed. A person is considered unemployed if they do not have a job, have actively looked for work in the prior 4 weeks, and are currently available for work. State refers to place of residence. N/A indicates that the estimates are not available because they did not meet the Bureau of Labor Statistics' publication standard of reliability or were otherwise unavailable."
Description,Annual average rate of unemployment.

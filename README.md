## Description

With the One Big Beautiful Bill Act of 2025, new changes will affect the future of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). SNAP helps nearly 42 million Americans a month fight food insecurity. This project examines how SNAP participation and benefits have evolved over the last two decades to highlight it's scope and it's success as a countercyclical policy during economic downturns and expansions.
